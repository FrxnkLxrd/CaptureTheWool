Author and original code: https://github.com/InsiderAnh/UltraCTW

Modify a few things in this plugin for my server.
I am a buyer of the plugin, and I read the license, I think there will be no problem uploading the code.

- Add titles
- Add Actionbar Messages
- Change Hypixel-like messages
- The level system and its rewards work well
- Now when starting the game check that the teams are balanced

- Added a menu showing the game status and your stats
- Now the autojoinfinish sends you directly to another game, only activated if you have more than 2 maps!
